						My motivation is mostly driven by making a difference in making the world a better place.
						Particularly, I want to make changes for people who are in small groups in the eye of society, so that they
						would get a better world through these changes. In the technology there can be made a lot possible for 
						a lot of people in different part of impact. I get motiviated by see what my work does or what it can show to people. 
						So that keeps me motivated intill I get in the position to make something that will help a lot of people.

						futher as a programmer.
						My professional goals are: finding the IT work that gets my attention; finding the

					<p>
						As a student I did an interview with a professional programmer, who is working on different kind
						of levels in the IT.
						Here I will go in the things that I learned about a Javascript developer, also because that is the
						kind of IT that appeals to me.
						<br><br>
						<b>Javascript developer</b><br>
						As a Javascript developer you will be responsible for the working of the applications,
						functions, testing and maintenance of
						all the things. That are the global things you will do, but there is more:
					<ul class="jobDescription">
						<li>Giving advice around the applications;</li>
						<li>Solving problems that applications can have;</li>
						<li>Making documation from Javascript code;</li>
						<li>Meetings with other developers to see what could be better.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
					This are a few things I didn't knew or things that are going a bit different than you would think.
					<br><br>
					Further for a young developer it is good to know that you always must have a contract in paper, so
					you will have the things you
					need to do your job. And it is good to always look around for other programm languages so you will
					become more valuable in skills,
					plus try to switch between 1 and 2 years from project (unless the company you work for, changes a
					lot in the kind of projects.). So
					you won't stay in the one kind of programme job but grow in your skills. For example, give yourself
					a challenge to create something you haven't
					done yet or create something you can within a timelimit.
