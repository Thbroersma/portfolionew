			<b>Animals;</b>
			"Animals are better than people", that is something I get from time to time. <br> When people let you down times again,
			animals are there always for you to cheer you up. <br> That's why I would recommend everyone I they feel down look around 
			<a href="image.php">here</a> or just <br> cuddle with one of the pets you know.
			<br>	
			<br>
			<b>Nature</b> is one of the best things that I enjoy and it helps. Like when your <br>
			head is too full with stuff and you can't get it back together, go on for <br>
			a walk in nature. It can help you to calm your brain and your spirit. Pair it sometimes with easy <br>
			music. It can refresh you in 20 to 30 minutes, can I say out of experience.

			As you have already read on my website, I am a hard-working person who is commited to his goals. 
			But I also like to enjoy the little things in life, like a relaxing walk through the forest or riding around on 
			my bicycle. I like enjoy things where you are in your element or when you do something and you see someone  
			else in their element. <br><br>For example, I like cycling a lot because you can enjoy the area around you, For example; 
			one day I went for a ride of 150 km. There were a lot of different area's with forests, fields and 
			the little towns. The fun part of it, is seeing the things and people but it is also a part of commitment. 
			Because you can also go to these places by car and enjoy it anyway, but no, if you go by bicycle  
			you are commited to see the whole journey. That is a big part of who I am: when I am commited to something I really go big 
			and far for it. The work I put into this site, my job and the people around me. You could think: is this all 
			the work you can put in it, but this is all the knowledge I have right now and I can put in it. There are a lot 
			more things I would like to put in this website and that will come when I have the knowledge I need to make it work.
